# FRC 2022

## Code Structure
This project will use the FSMSystem framework, representing each subsystem as a finite state machine.

## Code Conventions
We will base our code style off the [Sun Java style guide](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf).
 * Indentation: tabs
 * Braces: endline
 * Wrap lines at 80 characters

Some additional naming guidance:
 * Variable names: camelCase
 * Booleans should start with "is" or "has" (ex. hasMotor, isPositive)

The full style guidelines are enforced by [CheckStyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/). You may wish to install the [VSCode Checkstyle for Java plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-checkstyle) to automatically detect style errors.

## Commit messages
Everyone should read and follow the rules in "[How to write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)."
